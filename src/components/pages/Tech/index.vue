    <h3>Intel,the Connected World and African Start-Ups</h3>
    <p>For the past 8 months that I had to relocate to the US from Nigeria,
    its been the beginning of an ongoing process of understanding why some countries around the world make 
    great progresses while others continuously depend on them.As one who is keen and 
    involved in the startup ecosystem in Africa,It is a time to start connecting with the technology world to see and also 
    track the amazing innovations around the world (especially in US and Israel) and how our daily experiences in life are enhanced by these innovations.With this in mind,I will be sharing my experience  which will focus more on  informing and educating our readers on what major tech brands around the world are doing and how African Startups especially Nigerian Startups can 
    learn from their stories and also try to apply the same principles.
    Among the numerous challenges facing startups in Africa are lack of 
    an ecosystem that really supports technology and innovation and the 
    inability to know where the future of technology is as to create the 
    needed solutions,bring it to market on time hence build the company of 
    the future.Several efforts are on going to build the right ecosystems in 
    Africa for Start-up development,today I’ll like to remind you of the 
    current Tech trends around the world.We now live in a Connected world 
    where everything is becoming smart,the Internet of Things(IoT) is one big trend that has wide range of applications in our real world.A world where there are no barriers between the digital world and the physical world is being created-the Connected world.
    One tech company that is setting the pace for the next level of computing,making the transition from the physical world into the digital world seamless with blended realities is Intel.Intel is making great partnerships around the world especially with young startups to create this rich experience where everything is connected and smart.They have gone ahead to develop these technologies and are working with great innovators across different ages around the globe.Amazingly,young entrepreneurs around the world are leveraging these opportunities.
