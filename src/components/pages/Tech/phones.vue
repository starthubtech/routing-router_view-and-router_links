        <p>What is a SIM free phone? 
        SIM free phones are sold without any SIM card or network attached to them. Normally, people buy the phone and then choose a SIM only deal for their calls and data. All of our SIM free phones come unlocked, so you can choose whichever network you like – while Samsung Galaxy phones have to be used in the UK. 
        What are the benefits of buying a SIM free phone? 
        Normally, people buy a SIM free phone when they want to own the handset outright and take out a SIM only deal. This reduces the cost of a monthly plan as you are only paying the network for your minutes, texts and data allowance. SIM only deals aren’t only less expensive but they can be more flexible, as 
        1-month rolling contracts and 12-month contracts are common place.</p>
