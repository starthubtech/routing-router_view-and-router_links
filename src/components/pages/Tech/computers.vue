        <h2>Computers</h2>
        <p>A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out 
            sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically 
            via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability 
            to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. 
            These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide 
            range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work 
            together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster.</p>
